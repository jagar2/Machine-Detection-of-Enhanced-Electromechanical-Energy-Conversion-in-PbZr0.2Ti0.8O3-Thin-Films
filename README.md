Many energy conversion, sensing, and microelectronic applications based on ferroic materials are determined by the nanoscale domain structure evolution under applied stimuli. New hyperspectral, multidimensional spectroscopic techniques, now probe dynamic responses at relevant time and length scales providing an understanding of how these nanoscale domain structures impact macroscopic properties. Such approaches, however, remain limited in use because of the difficulties that exist in extracting and visualizing scientific insights from these complex datasets. Using multidimensional band-excitation scanning probe spectroscopy and adapting tools from both computer vision and machine learning, we develop an automated protocol to featurize, detect, and classify signatures of ferroelectric/ferroelastic switching processes in complex ferroelectric domain structures. This approach enables the identification and nanoscale visualization of varied modes of response and a pathway to statistically-meaningful quantification of the differences between those modes. Among other things, we spatially visualize the importance of domain geometry for enhancing nanoscale electromechanical energy conversion.
